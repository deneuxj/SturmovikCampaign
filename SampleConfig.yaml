    Briefing: |
        This mission is part of a dynamic campaign, where the events from one mission affect the following missions.
        
        Objectives: Truck convoys, tank columns, field camps (look for dugouts), factories, parked planes, anti-tank guns, anti-air cannons.
        
        Each region has a 'life bar' indicating the storage capacity (blue bar) and current supply level (cursor on the bar).
        If the cursor is red, the region is poorly defended.
        Some regions have numbers beside their name: these represent the number of tanks in that region at the start of the mission.
        
        Planes can be transferred from one airfield to another, but the result will only be visible in the next mission.

    # If non-empty, webhook URL of a discord channel where comments extracted from the ongoing mission log entries will be posted.
