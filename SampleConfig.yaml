    Briefing: |
        This mission is part of a dynamic campaign where the events from one mission affect the following missions.
        
        Objectives: Truck convoys, tank columns, field camps (look for dugouts), factories, parked planes, anti-air cannons.
        
        Each region has a 'life bar' indicating the storage health (colored bar) and current supply level (color of the bar).
        If the bar is red, the region is poorly defended. If it's green, it's fully defended.
        If the bar is short, it means storage is damaged. The shorter the bar, the mode damage.
        
        Some regions have numbers beside their name: these represent the number of tanks in that region at the start of the mission.
        
        Planes can be transferred from one airfield to another, but the result will only be visible in the next mission.

    # If non-empty, webhook URL of a discord channel where comments extracted from the ongoing mission log entries will be posted.
