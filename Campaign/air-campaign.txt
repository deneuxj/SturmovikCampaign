Map is divided in regions, each controlled by at most one side

Each side has a rear base

Each region may have an airfield, and each airfield has a number of operational facilities (ammo, fuel, repairs)

Each airfield has operational points, which can be affected negatively by raids, and positively by connection to the rear base

Each region has logistics infrastructure with neighbours: bridges, train stations, camps

Regions have connection capacity to the rear base depending on the state of logistics infrastructure on the paths to the rear base

An airfield is active if it has enough operational points

Each region has ground force points.
Each active airfield within range provides extra points.
Regions on the front lines deplete their points every turn.
Regions get new ground force points every turn depending on the state of logistics infrastructure.
When two enemy contiguous regions have a point difference that exceeds a certain threshold, the stronger one takes over the weaker one.

Targets of opportunity consist of truck convoys, ships, trains. They are randomly generated and destroying them affects replenishment of operational points

Tank columns are other targets of opportunity, and destroying them affects the ground force points

Ground battles occur across the front line, and the outcome affects the ground force points in the two involved opposing regions

The planes available at airfields depend on their operational points, and the history of flights.
Each campaign scenario includes the relative number of flights of each model, ideally following historical values.
When a plane is flown too often, it is removed from the plane set of the most popular airfields.
