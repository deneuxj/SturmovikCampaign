      "Briefing": "This mission is part of a dynamic campaign where the events from one mission affect the following missions.\n\nObjectives: Truck convoys, tank columns, field camps (look for dugouts), factories, parked planes, anti-air cannons.\n\nEach region has a 'life bar' indicating the storage health (colored bar) and current supply level (color of the bar).\nIf the bar is red, the region is poorly defended. If it's green, it's fully defended.\nIf the bar is short, it means storage is damaged. The shorter the bar, the mode damage.\n\nSome regions have numbers beside their name: these represent the number of tanks in that region at the start of the mission.\n\nPlanes can be transferred from one airfield to another, but the result will only be visible in the next mission.\n",
