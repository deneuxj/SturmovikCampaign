How to create a campaign map

1. Define campaign start date
Done in the mission properties dialog.

2. Define regions
Use influence areas.
They cannot overlap.
Each region's boundary must be convex.
Try to put region boundaries at natural obstacles, e.g. large rivers.
Each region must have a country, cannot be neutral.
Neighbouring regions must share contiguous segments. Corresponding vertices must be close.
In a region's boundary, vertices must be separated by at least 2km.
Airfields that participate in the campaign must all be located within some region.
Neighbouring regions should be connected by roads or rails. The roads and rails can go through other regions, or outside of all regions, but they must start and end in the two regions.
Avoid holes between regions, they will look ugly in the mission map and confuse players.
Put region icons on identifiable cities, need not be in the center of the region.
Put all regions in a group named "Regions".
Set region owners. Each coalition must own at least one region with factories.
In the initial world state, regions which have "***" in their Description are called "entry regions". Reinforcements appear in these regions.
The logistics system uses these entry regions as the place of reference for efficiency calculations:
A region which is isolated from all entry regions cannot function properly, meaning e.g. that ground forces there are weaker than normal.

3. Define logistics terminals
Create influence areas in a group named "Terminals". Each region should have at least one.
Those areas should cover cities that are communication hubs, for roads and railroads.
Any segment of road or rails inside these areas are locations where supplies can be loaded to and from other regions.
In order for a path over roads or rails to connect two regions that share an edge in their boundaries, the entire path must be covered by the two regions.
If you intend for a bridge to play an important role in the tactics, avoid spanning both sides of the bridge with terminal zones.

4. Define airfield areas
Use influence areas. The point of reference of each area must be inside a region.
Each area must be convex, have a unique name. The corners of the area will host AA groups, and should be clear from buildings, forests and water.
Buildings within the area will be counted as operational buildings of that airfield.
All these areas must be in group named "Airfields".

5. Define spawns and runways
Use fakefields for planes with runways.
Optionally, set the name of the fakefield to the name of the runway. This is often the direction of take-off and landing in degrees divided by 10.
If there are parallel runways, use a suffix to differentiate them (e.g. R for right). This is only for the players' convenience, it does not affect the campaign system.
Put the fakefields inside the group named "Airfields".
Do create the chart. It's needed for picking spawn points according to wind, and also for AIs that are landing.
The taxi points leading to the runway are meant for the AIs, not players. Keep the initial taxi point away from the spawn.
Create multiple spawn points, typically one at each runway end. This allows the mission generator to pick a takeoff and landing direction that faces the wind.
Airfields without runways are allowed. These can be used by players as alternative landing sites, but are otherwise ignored by the campaign system.

6. Windsocks (opt.)
Create windsocks with entities in a group named "Windsocks"

7. Non-directional beacons (opt.)
Create non-directional beacons (ndb under "vehicles") with entities in a group named "NDBs".
Set beacon channel to 1 in the advanced properties.
Keep the the number of NDBs low. The game puts them all in the same channel, so having too many of them will confuse players.

8. Landing fires (opt.)
Create landing fire effects with entities named "LandFire" in a group named "Land fires". Don't forget to set them on the ground.

9. Landing lights (opt.)
Create land lights with entities named "LandLight" in a group named "Land lights".
Create a pair for each runway so that planes will take off and land with the lights in their back.

10. Bridges
Road and rail bridges should be located in groups named "BridgesHW" and "BridgesRW", respectively.
They must not be located under the "Static" group (see below).

11. Other buildings
Buildings of strategic value as well as "valueless" buildings should be under a group named "Static".

12. Other data
Create a non-neutral fakefield outside of the play area, add at least a plane to it (any plane will do)
Set the mission type to deathmatch.

13. Countries
The participating countries and their coalition are edited in the dialog that open when clicking on "Countries..." in the mission's properties.
Set all non-participating to Neutral.

14. Briefing
Write a short description of the object of the fight in the description of the mission.
