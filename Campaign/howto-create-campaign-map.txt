How to create a campaign map

1. Define campaign start date
Done in the mission properties dialog.

2. Define regions
Use influence areas.
They cannot overlap.
Each region's boundary must be convex.
Neighbouring regions must share contiguous segments. Corresponding vertices must be close.
In a region's boundary, vertices must be separated by at least 2km.
Airfields that participate in the campaign must all be located within some region.
Neighbouring regions should be connected by roads or rails. The roads and rails can go through other regions, or outside of all regions, but they must start and end in the two regions.
Avoid holes between regions, they will look ugly in the mission map and confuse players.
Put region icons on identifiable cities, need not be in the center of the region.
Put all regions in a group named "Regions".
Set region owners. Each coalition must own at least one region with factories.
In the initial world state, regions which have "***" in their Description are fully supplied. Those are the "strong bases".
Other regions are supplied depending on their distance to the nearest strong base.

3. Define airfield areas
Use influence areas. The point of reference of each area must be inside a region.
Each area must be convex, have a unique name. The corners of the area will host AA groups, and should be clear from buildings, forests and water.
Buildings within the area will be counted as operational buildings of that airfield.
All these areas must be in group named "Airfields".

4. Define spawns and runways
Use fakefields for planes with runways. Include *** in the Description field to specify that this runway is suitable for the me262 and bombers with 1500Kg of bombs or more.
Optionally, set the name of the fakefield to the name of the runway. This is often the direction of take-off and landing in degrees divided by 10.
If there are parallel runways, use a suffix to differentiate them (e.g. R for right). This is only for the players' convenience, it does not affect the campaign system.
Put the fakefields inside the group named "Airfields".
Do create the chart. It's needed for picking spawn points according to wind, and also for AIs that are landing.
The taxi points leading to the runway will be used to put direction signs in the game to help spawning players to get to the runway.
Create multiple spawn points, typically one at each runway end. This allows the mission generator to pick a takeoff and landing direction that faces the wind.
These alternative waypoints should all have the same name (typically the name of the airfield).

5. Define rail network
Create a network of connected waypoints. Nodes of degree 1 in the network (endpoints) identify the start/end regions. Internal nodes must be located on logistics-critical installations, such as stations and bridges.
Put these waypoints in a group called "Rail".
Networks are used to detect when a region is connected to neighbouring regions. Isolated regions get quickly weaker.

6. Define road network
Same as for the rail, but in a group called "Road"

7. Windsocks
Create windsocks with entities in a group named "Windsocks"

8. Non-directional beacons
Create non-directional beacons (ndb under "vehicles") with entities in a group named "NDBs".
Set beacon channel to 1 in the advanced properties.
Keep the the number of NDBs low. The game puts them all in the same channel, so having too many of them will confuse players.

9. Land fires
Create land fire effects with entities named "LandFire" in a group named "Land fires". Don't forget to set them on the ground.

10. Land lights
Create land lights with entities named "LandLight" in a group named "Land lights".
Create a pair for each spawn so that planes will take off and land with the lights in their back.

11. Bridges and other buildings
Bridges and other blocks, buildings... need not be in groups, although they can.
You can import the standard templates and leave them as is. The mission generation script will remove everything that's not in a region, and keep the rest.
