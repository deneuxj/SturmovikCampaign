How to create a campaign map

1. Define campaign start date
Done in the mission properties dialog.

2. Define regions
Use influence areas.
They cannot overlap.
Each region's boundary must be convex.
Neighbouring regions must share contiguous segments. Corresponding vertices must be close.
In a region's boundary, vertices must be separated by at least 2km.
Airfields that participate in the campaign must all be located within some region.
Neighbouring regions should be connected by roads or rails. The roads and rails can go through other regions, or outside of all regions, but they must start and end in the two regions.
Avoid holes between regions, they will look ugly in the mission map and confuse players.
Put region icons on identifiable cities, need not be in the center of the region.
Put all regions in a group named "Regions".
Set region owners. Each coalition must own at least one region with factories.

3. Define roads and railways
Each path must start with a waypoint named "Start" and finish with another one named "End".
Each path is bidirectional, so you don't need (and must not) define another identical path going in the opposite direction.
The speed, altitude and radius of waypoints do not matter.
The direction matters, and should be a tangent of the road/railway at the location of the waypoint.
Roads must be put in a group called "Roads", railways must be in "Trains".
Each bridge should be preceded by a waypoint named "BeforeBridge" and followed by a waypoint named "AfterBridge".
Make sure you place the waypoints on the actual location of the road. You need to use the terrain view in the editor, as the GUI map is often misaligned.
Consecutive waypoints should be separated by at most 20km (direct line).
For roads, it is a advisable to have waypoints on each side of the border, before the first AT defense zones.

4. Place factories
Place static blocks with entities in a group named "Factories"
Suitable static blocks are: "industrial_200x140_01", "industrial_200x140_02", "industrial_300x100_01",
"industrial_300x100_02", "industrial_300x100_03", "industrial_300x100_04", "industrial_cornerl_01",
"industrial_cornerl_02", "industrial_cornerr_01", "industrial_cornerr_02"

5. Place supply storage
Place static blocks with entities in a group named "Storage".
Suitable static blocks are: "arf_barak" (100), "arf_dugouts_2" (400), "arf_dugouts_3" (600), "arf_ammo_1" (100)
Number between parentheses above are the storage capacity of each static block.
Storage is used for anti-tank (AT) and anti-air (AAA) defenses. Each gun consumes 50.
		
6. Define AAA defense zones
Use influence areas named AAA in a group named "Defenses".
Each area must be located within a region.
The size of the area decides the number of canons. There is 1 gun per 100000m^2

7. Define AT defense zones
Use influence areas named AT in a group named "Defenses".
Orient the influence area so that its yellow pointer aims at incoming tanks.
Place these area along each road into the region.
Each area must be located within a region.
The size of the area decides the number of guns. There is 1 gun per 26000m^2

Make sure there is enough storage in the region for all the canons in the defense areas.

8. Define airfield spawn points
Use fakefields for planes. Both types (sideways and runway) can be used.
Do create the chart. It's needed for picking spawn points according to wind, and also for AIs that are landing.
Create multiple spawn points, typically one at each runway end. This allows the mission generator to pick a takeoff and landing direction that faces the wind.
These alternative waypoints should all have the same name (typically the name of the airfield).

9. Place plane parking spots

10. Place tank parking areas
