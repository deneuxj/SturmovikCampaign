--- bugs & small improvements ---

X supplies not destroyed when damaging storage
X supplies not wasted when exceeding storage capacity
X tank offset in event names are always 0
X more generous supply sharing
X More permissive damage handling for planes. When plane with health > 75% lands, register as 100% healthy plane.
X better map icons and lines
X German notification plates.
X Searchlights in AA defenses.
X Check if tank transfer works (are tanks removed from start region?)
X No resupply orders issued
X Missing AT defenses?
X More defensive AI
X Add temps to weather description in briefing
X Use one-shot check zone triggers for spotting, no need for WECs
X Fix bugs in minmax code. Russians don't go capture Rzhev after they have eliminated all German tanks, which is strange.
X Include airfield content in evaluation.
X Show AI patrols on the map
X AI patrols should be free to decide to RTB
X Shorter patrol circuit
X Add entities to every building the AI might want to attack.
X Optimization: only output AT canons when there is an invasion planned.
X Reduce durability of parked bombers
X Spotted AT guns should not be shown, or at least shown with a specific icon, different from AAA
X Landing lights.
X Wind socks.
X Beacons.
X Add static object with long visibility among parked tanks
X Optimization: Spawn AI fighter patrol on proximity
X Fighters should not disappear while there is an enemy plane nearby.
X Keep tanks around for a little while after they arrive at destination
X Trucks should only be lost when registered as destroyed. When departed but not arrived, they should be considered as arrived.
X Check if interception of tanks really works. (logs evening may 8 around 20.00, heavy cloud cover)
X Increase maximal distance between vehicles, they are too vulnerable at the moment.
X Battles at regions with airfields must damage planes too.
X Some tank/truck kills are missed. For trucks, can block later convoys/trains.
X Check and fix spawn of fighter patrols.
? Generate mission logic for AI transports.
Paratrooper drop result handling (affect battles).
Notify players when their units are under attack (with a delay).
Runway selection when wind blows from the south does not work.
Check for convoys without trucks.
? Airplane to produce never changes for each type.
? Prioritize AI patrols according to assets being protected.
X Damaged hangars appear undamaged.
