--- bugs & small improvements ---

? Generate mission logic for AI transports
Make landing crafts move faster.
Notify players when their units are under attack (with a delay)
? Destroyed bridges do not prevent tank battles in next mission if mission ends before tanks reach the destroyed bridge.
Blocked, non-destroyed truck/train convoys must start the next convoy when discarded.
