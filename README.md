A set of F# libraries to parse and manipulate mission files in IL-2: Battle of Stalingrad.

### Current status ###

Not usable yet.

All interesting code is in project DataProvider.

Autoschema.fs can read a sample reference mission file to guess the grammar and generate a parser to read actual mission files.

The next step is to make a type provider, allowing to manipulate a mission file interactively in Visual Studio / FSI.

### How do I get set up? ###

Build with Visual Studio 2013. No external dependencies beside F#.

### Who do I talk to? ###
